short_term_1,"Yes, short-term side effects like higher temperature and flu-like symptoms are not pleasant, however, much better than getting COVID-19. You can read more here: https://tinyurl.com/y6gr9ucw ",side_effects
short_term_2,"Short term side effects such as fever, fatigue or general body aches are normal. They arise from the body's immune system response which is actually a sign that the vaccine works and is doing its job.",side_effects
fast_dev_1,"Yes, the vaccine was developed quickly. That's because a lot of funding and research priority is currently directed at developing COVID-19 vaccines around the world. As a result, the process is being sped up, allowing for more clinical trials to take place in a shorter period of time. Here is a video that explains the process: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l0f0NugUMk&t=0s.",fast_development
fast_dev_2,"It has been over 200 years since the first vaccine was invented - a lot of medical research and innovation has taken place since that time. It is wrong to believe that the work on the vaccine started when the pandemic began. After SARS and EBOLA, many research institutions were working on methods that would allow them to develop vaccines faster.",fast_development
fast_dev_3,"Other factors, such as China quickly sharing the genetic information about the virus and the fact that social media makes it easier to recruit volunteers, sped up the development process of the vaccines.",fast_development
young_1,"Young people are indeed less likely to die, however there's increasing evidence that COVID can cause long-term effects - such as permanent neurological changes and damage to multiple organs - even in fit and healthy individuals who contract the virus. Evidence suggests that around one in nine 17-24 year olds and one in six 25-34 year olds will suffer long-term effects if they catch COVID while unvaccinated (https://tinyurl.com/54zb8n9r). Here's a video explaining 'long COVID': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N4xBXphyxg.",healthy
young_2,"There have been cases of people, both young and healthy, contracting and consequently dying from COVID-19 and currently there is no definitive understanding of how this happens. Therefore we cannot say that just because someone is young and healthy COVID poses no threat.",healthy
young_3,"You personally may be able to recover from COVID, however, there is a significant chance that you will pass onto someone else, such as an elderly neighbour or relative, who has a much higher chance of suffering debilitiating effects and possibly dying as a result.",healthy
long_term_1,"This is a very hypothetical argument. You are right, we do not know whether there will be any long term side effects from the vaccine. However, problems from COVID-19 are far more likely than long term effects from a vaccine where the ingredients are known (if you're interested, here's a video about 'long COVID':  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N4xBXphyxg).",long_term_effects
long_term_2,"In the past, there have been only a few cases where mistakes happened during vaccine development and they all happened a very long time ago. Also, all these vaccines contained an active component of the virus which is not the case for the COVID-19 vaccine.",long_term_effects
long_term_3,"Yes, we don't know but we also do not know the long-term effects of COVID. These are far more threatening and likely to develop than long-term side effects from a vaccine.",long_term_effects
long_term_4,"Yes, we do not know whether there will be any long term side effects from the vaccine but based on our long history of vaccine development we can assume that this is very unlikely to happen.",long_term_effects
mutation_1,"All the COVID-19 vaccines are based on generating an immune response to the COVID-19 spike protein. Helpfully, the spike protein is quite large (in virus terms), consisting of around 1,270 amino acids. That means the immune system generates many different antibodies to different parts of the spike. So a few changes in the spike protein shouldn't mean that the vaccine won't work. For example, the UK variant has nine mutations to the spike gene, but 99 percent of the spike is still identical to the version the vaccines were designed to target. ",mutation
mutation_2,"According to the WHO none of the mutations has made a significant impact on either the susceptibility of the virus to any of the currently used therapeutics, drugs or the vaccines in use or under development. It has been confirmed that the Pfizer vaccine is 88% effective against the Delta (Indian) variant two weeks after the second does (please read this article for more details: https://tinyurl.com/4hehnm6p).",mutation
flu_1,"No, COVID is not like the flu and should not be compared to it. COVID-19 survivors report many more long-term effects of the infection than influenza survivors. Lingering symptoms like weakness, shortness of breath, trouble focusing, and, in some cases, kidney and heart problems are much more common after COVID-19 than after the flu. COVID also has 20 times the death rate of the flu (averaging around 2% compared to 0.1% for the flu).",flu
flu_2,"We do not know yet whether this vaccine will have to be taken each year, like the flu. This is also not important right now. At the very moment, it is important to achieve herd immunity and bring cases down.",flu
safety_1,"The vaccines were all very well tested during transparent clinical trials and all data is publicly available. Some of the vaccine developers conducted some stages of the process simultaneously to gather as much data as possible, but no steps were skipped.",safety
safety_2,"There is no reason to believe the vaccine is not safe. News that people are dying from it is not correct. The elderly are the first to get the vaccine; these people usually have many pre-existing health conditions. They die from those and their advanced age, not the vaccine.",safety
safety_3,"So far, no serious safety concerns have been identified for any of the vaccines. Only people with a history of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) to vaccines should consult their doctor first. For the rest of the population, the vaccine is safe to take.",safety
default_1,"if enough people get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity we can finally go back to normal life. We will be able to travel, go out and meet friends again!",default
default_2,"a vaccine is the only safe way to create herd immunity which is necessary to stop the virus from spreading. This will protect us all from getting the virus, as well as those who, for some reason, cannot get the vaccine.",default
default_3,"after getting the vaccine you won't have to worry about developing severe symptoms even after catching COVID. And if you convince your family and friends to get it, you also won't have to worry about them catching COVID and possibly developing severe symptoms.",default
death_1,"News that people are dying from the vaccine is not correct. The elderly are the first to get the vaccine - these people usually have many pre-existing health conditions. They die from those and their age, not the vaccine.",death
get_covid_1,"Early signs are that people who have been vaccinated are far less likely to become seriously ill with coronavirus, which is what we need in order to prevent the healthcare system from collapsing and start loosening restrictions. This means that you might still transmit it, but if everyone gets vaccinated that is not a problem.",get_spread_covid
had_covid_1,"We don’t current know how long natural immunity lasts after contracting COVID. It is likely that this varies significantly from person to person - so, even if you’re sure you had COVID previously, it is stil necessary for you to get the vaccine to make sure you develop long-lasting protection.",already_had
survival_rate_1,"Yes, it is not a very deadly virus but can result in 'long COVID' which can cause a wide range of damaging symptons, possibly for an indefinite period of time.",high_survival_rate
fertility_1,This is misinformation spread on social media. Evidence has not been presented that women who have been vaccinated have gone on to have fertility problems.,fertility
effective_1,"The effectiveness of the vaccine was assessed during the  clinical trials (see, for example: https://tinyurl.com/4z7tws9s) and is being continuously assessed and evaluated by experts in real-world conditions. There is no reason to believe that the vaccines do not work.",effectiveness
natural_herd_immunity_1,Relying on 'natural' herd immunity is not an option. Other countries have tried it and failed (like Sweden) and it makes it impossible to protect those at the highest risk. Here is an article that explains why we should not rely on herd immunity: https://tinyurl.com/5ravj5c9.,natural_herd_immunity
ingredients_1,People use products and consume food all the time without questioning its impact on their health. None of the ingredients in the vaccine are harmful. Here is an overview of the ingredients in the Pfizer vaccine: https://tinyurl.com/4mamsm36 and here is the ingredient list of the AstraZeneca vaccine: https://tinyurl.com/xz6t595c.,injecting_unknown_substance
