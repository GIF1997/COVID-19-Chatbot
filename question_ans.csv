side_effects,"Reported side effects to the vaccines have mostly been mild to moderate and short lasting, usually starting within 48 hours of vaccination and lasting for less than one week. They can include fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, diarrhoea, and pain at the injection site, but none have had a prolonged detrimental effect or have been life threatening. This is because your immune system temporarily causes an increase in blood flow so more immune cells can circulate and raises your body temperature in order to kill the virus.",side_effects
fast_development,"The first vaccine to be approved in the UK, created as a collaboration between Pfizer and BioNTech (two leading pharmaceutical companies), was developed in under a year, much faster than average which is around 10 years. This unprecedented achievement was able to be accomplished due to a number of factors, including previous work that had been carried out on vaccines for other coronaviruses (such as SARS and MERS)  and widescale global cooperation made possible by huge amounts of funding. Ingredients in the Pfizer vaccine are mRNA, lipids, potassium chloride, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate dehydrate and sucrose. None of these ingredients have any know negative health effects in humans.",fast_development
healthy,"Young people are indeed less likely to die, however there's increasing evidence that COVID can cause long term effects - such as permanent neurological changes and damage to multiple organs - even in fit and healthy individuals who contract the virus. Evidence suggests that around one in nine 17-24 year olds and one in six 25-34 year olds will suffer long term effects if they catch COVID while unvaccinated.",healthy
long_term_effects,"There are no vaccines that cause long term effects that did not show up within the first month after the final dose. Two varieties of COVID vaccine are given twice, and the mRNA in the vaccine is degraded very quickly. This is the same for other vaccines, so there is no reason to have long term effects when the vaccine is no longer present in the body. A rare side effect called myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, has been reported in some people receiving Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines – about one in a million. In those cases, the side effect occurred from several days to two weeks after vaccination, and most patients responded well to treatment and felt better quickly. The immunity from the vaccine has been reported to last beyond 12 months, depending on the person taking it and if a booster shot is administered. The long term effects of the COVID virus can include breathlessness, headaches, cough, fatigue, cognitive impairment or ‘brain fog’ and even organ damage. Residual symptoms from the virus, such as persistent breathlessnes and inability to focus,  have been reported to last for over a year in some cases.",long_term_effects
mutation,"All the COVID vaccines are based on generating an immune response to the COVID spike protein. Helpfully, the spike protein is quite large (in virus terms), consisting of around 1,270 amino acids. That means the immune system generates many different antibodies to different parts of the spike. So a few changes in the spike protein should not mean that the vaccine won't work. For example, the UK variant has nine mutations to the spike gene, but 99 percent of the spike is still identical to the version the vaccines were designed to target. The Delta variant is almost twice as transmissable as the original strain of the virus, however immunity conferred by mRNA vaccines is likely to be retained against the Delta variant.",mutation
flu,"COVID survivors report many more long-term effects of the infection than influenza survivors. Lingering symptoms like weakness, shortness of breath, trouble focusing, and, in some cases, kidney and heart problems are much more common after COVID than after the flu. COVID has 20 times the death rate of the flu (averaging around two percent compared to a tenth of a percent for the flu).",flu
safety,"A rare side effect called myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, has been reported in some people receiving Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines – about one in a million. In those cases, the side effect occurred from several days to two weeks after vaccination, and most patients responded well to treatment and felt better quickly. In pregnant and lactating women a survey of more than 17,000 individuals has shown that the vaccine is well tolerated . The vaccine has been proven to be safe and highly effective for children over the age of twelve.",safety
default,"The current situation in Israel is bad, but there are solutions such as mantaining social distancing and administering a third 'booster' shot of the vaccine. Allergic reactions to the vaccine are found in roughly 11 people per million, so it is very unlikely to be a problem for any individual. Reports that the government are tracking people with microchips in the vaccine are entirely fictitious. Ingredients in the Pfizer vaccine are mRNA, lipids, potassium chloride, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate dehydrate and sucrose. None of the ingredients in the vaccine are harmful to the human body. The symptoms of COVID can vary in severity and type, but usually include a high fever, a cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.",default
death,"News that people are dying from the vaccine is not correct. The elderly are the first to get the vaccine - these people usually have many pre-existing health conditions. They die from those and their age, not the vaccine. The chances of dying from COVID vary significantly with respect to age, co-morbidities and vaccination status, ranging from less than a tenth of a percent to almost eight percent. The chances of dying directly from the vaccine are virtually zero - reports of people who have died are circumstantial and largely fabricated.",death
get_spread_covid,"Early signs are that people who have been vaccinated are far less likely to become seriously ill with coronavirus, which is what we need in order to prevent the healthcare system from collapsing and start loosening restrictions. This means that you might still transmit it, but if everyone gets vaccinated that is not a problem.",get_spread_covid
already_had,"We don’t current know how long natural immunity lasts after contracting COVID. It is likely that this varies significantly from person to person - so, even if you’re sure you had COVID previously, it is stil necessary for you to get the vaccine to make sure you develop long lasting protection.",already_had

natural_herd_immunity,Relying on 'natural' herd immunity is not an option. Other countries have tried it and failed (like Sweden) and it makes it impossible to protect those at the highest risk.
