People already have got side effects.,side_effects
I have some concerns about possible side effects too with such a new vaccine that has been rushed through. Therefore in some respects I would sooner not get it too quickly as you have longer to evaluate impact of the vaccine if any in a negative way.,side_effects

Long term side effects are unknown.,long_term_effects
I believe the covid-19 vaccine does not stop the spreading and it's said that it will not maintain immunity in a person for very long. So it means I would need to take fairly unconventional vaccines regularly without knowing the long term side effects.,long_term_effects

I am not confident that it has been tested properly.,safety
It hasnât been tested enough ,safety

It is not safe,safety
Just want to make sure itâs safe,safety
I am unsure if the vaccines have been properly tested and are safe and efficient. ,safety

Safety of the vaccine cannot be guaranteed.,safety
they made the vaccine very quick,fast_development
It was produced too quickly.,fast_development
Seems abit rushed out,fast_development
"There was a lot of pressure to get these vaccines made and approved as quickly as possible, so I'm not completely sure about the evaluation of secondary effects",fast_development
I do not want to get a COVID-19 vaccine because I feel that it was still in the trial phase and it was rushed.,fast_development
It's not that I definitely don't want one but given how quickly they've been rolled out I'd be concerned if they are actually effective.,fast_development
I don't trust a rushed vaccine.,fast_development
"Vaccine trials and production were rushed very quickly, and possible side effects may not be seen in the short term.",fast_development
I still have concerns about safety after such a short production and testing time and need more reassurance and evidence of this.,fast_development

I am young and I don't feel like getting a vaccine,healthy
I am young and very healthy.,healthy
I am healthy and 34 years old. So even if get infected the chances that I will need to go to a hospital are very few.,healthy
II am a young and healthy person,healthy
I don't consider it necessary since covid is just a strain of flu and I have good immune system. ,healthy
I am young and probably there won't be serious consequences if I get sick from covid-19.,healthy
"I'm young, healthy and exercise regularly, there aren't many chances of me getting serious symptoms if I get covid.",healthy
"I don't need it as I believe I am healthy, and capable of fighting it myself.",healthy
"I am a young and healthy 30 year old, I believe my body would be strong enough",healthy
 There is clear evidence that a healthy balanced diet & active lifestyle protects against illness & viruses. The stronger & healthier we are the stronger our immune system. ,healthy
Covid poses no risk to those who are generally healthy with no underlying health conditions,healthy
Having a healthy lifestyle minimises the risk,healthy
"Vaccine shouldn't be mandatory, especially not for people of high risk as it is not a deadly virus on its own and for a healthy organism. The deaths were of people that already had health issues.",healthy
I am convinced that I wont have fatal complications. I am healthy and would rather get the disease naturally than expose myself to a new vaccine,healthy
"It is not that deadly and if people lived a more sustainable and healthy lifestyle, none of this would be a concern",healthy
I am young and healthy and not scared of the virus,healthy
healthy people shouldnt be worried about the virus. This is a wake up call for everyone how unsustainable and unhealthy we are living,healthy
I am not worried about catching it. I have a strong immune system and will be fine,healthy
Too much mutations of this virus ,mutation
vaccines unlikely helps for new variant of covid virus according to some uk scientists ,mutation
"The virus mutates and so any vaccine is only temporarily effective. Seems like a waste of resources and effort to get a shot that will only last a few months. Again, I feel the same way about the flu vaccine.",mutation
"The virus can keep mutating, rendering the vaccine ineffective.",mutation
Doubt that it will even work against all the new strains and variants that are coming out.,mutation
the virus may mutate and then such a vaccine will be ineffective,mutation
the virus mght mutate and therefore render any vaccine useless,mutation
"if the virus changes it’s form, the developed vaccine may not be suitable for that changed type",mutation
"if covid is like the flu, the virus might mutate. The vaccine will therefore be ineffective",mutation
there is a risk that the virus mutates and the vaccines will not work on that new strain,mutation
I dont want to get a new vaccine every time the virus mutates,mutation
"I don't think COVID-19 is serious enough for me to go out of my way to get a vaccine. For example, I get my Tetanus shots but I've never gotten shots for the seasonal flu because I can deal with that if I do get sick.",flu
"I don't get vaccines for illnesses that are very unlikely to kill or disfigured me. For things like the corona virus and the flu, I'd rather get sick and recover with natural immunity. Immune systems need to get exercise in order to stay strong.",flu
I never get a flu vaccine because the one time I did I got the flu,flu
"i do not get flu jab yearly, why should i get this one",flu
I have never even got a flu shot so I'm definitely not getting this vaccine. ,flu
covid19 is a coronavirus which is a stronger version of the common cold which is a coronavirus. if you cant cure the common cold or all flu then how can you cure a disease which is along the similar lines and has been around a shorter time,flu
HAVE NOT TAKEN FLU SHOT FOR 10 YEAR AND HAVE NOT GOTTEN THE FLU. IF THIS VACCINE BECOMES A YEARLY SHOT I AM VERY UNLIKELY TO GET IT EVERY YEAR.  ,flu
"I've never gotten a flu vaccine either. I'm not at all scared of getting a virus with such a high rate of survival, much live COVID-19. ",flu
Regular flu has a higher death rate than COVID-19.,flu
ive had covid19 and it was weaker than any flu i have had.,flu
